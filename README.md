<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
### Background
* There are not many effective applications for the Alumni
Association. That's why the Institute at times struggles to
organize and collect alumni details for effectively using
the alumni information. There are many alumni
association portal available but many of them do not
provide full fledge solution. In those systems Admin is only
having the sole authority for manipulating details of
alumni. Alumni canâ€™t modify their personal details. The
process is very slow and it takes time to find the Alumni
data and there is no assurance of the confidentiality of the
alumni data. Traditional portals are static just providing
information about the university, less engaging and do
not involve current students and faculty which would
otherwise provide a stronger network for the entire
community.

### Summary
*The proposed system Alumni Association portal gives the
Institute a corporate and unified platform for
communication and collaboration. This system will
provide better networking platforms that will maximize
alumni engagement while minimizing the effort and time
spent by the university.
*The alumni, current students, faculty and the
administrator will be the authorized users of the system.
Alumni can be member of this application if they have
signed up and provided necessary information in the
alumni profile. Non-members can just view the main page
and cannot access alumni profile. This system will provide
various features such as plan and register events to
organize Information, advanced search options, featured
alumni scrolls etc. Even the searching for a particular
student will be done very easily using this software
compared to the conventional process which is often time
consuming. The details of the alumni can be retrieved
easily in less time. For security purpose, these detail is
made available only to the registered and authenticated
users.

### Objective
*Alumni Directory: The Alumni Association portal allows
alumni to register and update the profile and send the
notification for job and other information such as
events or conference notifications to admin.
*Admin Directory: The system allows admin to update
the events, sending message the batch wise alumni,
view all alumni profile.
*Photo Galleries: The system allows publishing of
photos.
*Event Notification: The system allows admin to upload
the events in that admin can choose event, job or
meeting and message send by batch wise alumni.
*Tracer study of alumni whether they are employed in
industries, engaged as instructors, self employed,
entrepreneurship, any further trainings undergone etc.
*For Industries: They may find the best skilled personal
relevant to their sector and needs
*For Alumni: better job opportunities, career building,
workshops/programs post their training programs.
There should be central dashboard to maintain all the
activity with detail log report.
